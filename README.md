# gro-to-grockly

The purpose of this code is to be able to convert .gro code to grockly blocks ready to be read, simulated or edited easily.
This is part of Fernando Moreno's computer science end-of-degree work.

TO-DO LIST:

..* ~~open github repository~~
..* incorporate grockly and figure how to translate a line of code into a block
..* (then maybe open grockly and fill the data structures necessary?)
..* learn how to generate a block in screen
..* use gro to validate gro files
..* incorporate css
